# Checksum Sharer (built with JavaFX)

## Status

**Don't use in production**. This software is currently under development.

## What is Checksum Sharer?

"Checksum Sharer" is a desktop application that can be used to create checksums (e.g. SHA256, SHA512, SHA3-512) of any files. Depending on the
configuration, the checksums can be stored in text files or published to predefined locations (e.g. local file system, Dropbox, etc.). This has the
advantage that you do not necessarily have to store original files in cloud services, but can still prove that they existed unchanged at a certain
point in time thanks to the version history of most cloud services, should this be necessary at some point.

## Features

### Planned Features

- Multiple export options (e.g. Twitter, Dropbox, Nextcloud, OneDrive etc.)
- Configurable checksum algorithms (e.g. SHA256, SHA512 etc.)

## Will there be a mobile application of the "Checksum Sharer"?

I hope and think so. Once this software is running stably, mobile operating systems such as Android will be served using a cross-platform framework
such as Flutter.
